# HaDes CPU
Simple CPU implemented in VHDL. All credits goes to the **Microcontroller Design, Laboratory** group at TU Graz, especially to **Dipl.-Ing. Tobias Scheipel** and to **Prof. Dr. Marcel Baunach**, for providing the template and all necessary files for compilation and simulation. Code written by me is primarily in the `./CPU_implementation/rtl` directory. 

# HaDes Instruction Set Compiler
I have written a compiler of a subset of the C language for the HaDes instruction ser in the `compiler/` directory, see more detail in the [README.md](compiler/README.md) there.
