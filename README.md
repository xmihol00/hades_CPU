# HaDes CPU
Simple CPU implemented in VHDL. All credits goes to the TU Graz and the **Microcontroller Design, Laboratory** group, especially to **Dipl.-Ing. Tobias Scheipel** and to **Prof. Dr. Marcel Baunach**, for supplying the template and all necessary files for compilation and simulation. Code written by me (David Mihola) is primarly in the `./CPU_implementation/rtl` directory.
